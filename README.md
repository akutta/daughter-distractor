### Background

My daughter is young and hates car rides.  We might get lucky and get 30 minutes of sleeping, but with the in-laws living 1.5 hrs away, it takes a ton of effort to keep her entertained.

Recently, she started being obsessed with remote controls.  My theory is that the visual feedback from button presses were interesting to her.


I pulled this project together using most of the base code generation from New -> Game in XCode and hooked in the GameController framework.

This should be compatible with XBox and PS game controllers; however, I have only tested with a PS4 controller.

Hopefully my daughter likes this enough and maybe encourages her to like video games in the future :D
